Dear Solarman Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request access to the Solarman Smart RESTful API for integration purposes. We are currently working on a project that involves monitoring and analyzing solar energy data from Solarman-compatible devices, and we would like to use your API to retrieve real-time and historical data.

Could you please provide the necessary credentials (App ID and App Secret) and documentation to get started? If there are any prerequisites or forms to complete, kindly let me know.

Here are some details about our use case:
- Company/Organization: [Your Company Name]
- Intended Use: [e.g., internal monitoring dashboard, third-party integration, research, etc.]
- Devices/Plants Involved: [Optional – list device types or serial numbers if available]

Thank you for your support. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Position]
